## Maravel PHP Framework

Macropay-Solutions Maravel is an improvement inspired by Lumen  10.0.4 and Laravel packages v10.48.29

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs).

## Contributing

We plan to not change the code that often and allow you to build packages that use the DI container to extend functionality and also allow retroactive bug fixing but, we are open to suggestions.
